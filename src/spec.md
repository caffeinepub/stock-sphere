## Summary
**Goal:** Add a course marketplace where traders can create, monetize, and enroll in trading courses.

**Planned changes:**

- Implement backend endpoints for creating courses, retrieving courses, enrolling in courses, and checking enrollment status
- Create marketplace page displaying all available courses in a grid layout with course cards
